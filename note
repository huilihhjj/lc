Update
==================================
UPDATE [LOW_PRIORITY] [IGNORE] table_references
    SET assignment_list
    [WHERE where_condition]
* With the [LOW_PRIORITY] modifier, execution of the UPDATE is delayed until no other clients are reading from the table.
* With the [IGNORE] modifier, the update statement does not abort even if errors occur during the update. 
UPDATE IGNORE statements, including those having an ORDER BY clause, are flagged as unsafe for statement-based replication.
